# Immersive Web SDK

The **Immersive Web SDK** makes building immersive web experiences as approachable as traditional web development. It's a complete collection of frameworks and tools that eliminates the steep learning curve and months of setup traditionally required for WebXR development.

## Breaking Down the Barriers

Historically, creating immersive web experiences meant wrestling with complex 3D math, building interaction systems from scratch, and navigating fragmented WebXR APIs. Developers had to choose between spending months on infrastructure or settling for basic, non-interactive experiences.

IWSDK changes this by providing a **complete foundation** that handles the complexity for you—from physics and spatial audio to grab interactions and scene understanding—so you can focus on building great experiences instead of reinventing the wheel.

## Built on Three Core Pillars

### **Modern Architecture**
Built on **Three.js**, the most popular JavaScript 3D library, paired with a high-performance **Entity Component System** that scales from simple prototypes to complex applications. You get familiar foundations with the performance and flexibility to grow.

### **Developer-First Workflow** 
One-command setup gets you running in under a minute. Visual scene composition with **Meta Spatial Editor**, HTML-syntax spatial UI authoring, automated asset optimization, and **built-in emulation**—no VR hardware required to get started.

### **Production-Ready Systems**
Pre-built systems for everything immersive experiences need: grab interactions, locomotion, spatial audio, physics integration, and scene understanding. These systems can save you months of development time and work seamlessly together.
