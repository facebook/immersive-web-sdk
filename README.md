The **Immersive Web SDK** makes building immersive web experiences as approachable as traditional web development. It's a complete collection of frameworks and tools built on **Three.js** with a high-performance **Entity Component System**, **developer-first workflow** with one-command setup and built-in emulation, and **production-ready systems** for grab interactions, locomotion, spatial audio, physics, and scene understanding.

**Same code, two experiences**: Run immersively in VR/AR headsets and automatically provide mouse-and-keyboard emulation on desktop browsers. No browser extensions, no special setup—anyone with a laptop can develop for the immersive web.

## Getting Started

Create a new project with a single command:

```bash
npm create @iwsdk@latest
```

Or install into an existing project:

```bash
npm install @iwsdk/core three
```

## Packages

| Package                                              | Description                                       |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| [@iwsdk/core](./packages/core)                       | Core SDK with ECS, systems, and WebXR integration |
| [@iwsdk/create](./packages/create)                   | CLI for scaffolding new projects                  |
| [@iwsdk/locomotor](./packages/locomotor)             | Locomotion engine for Three.js WebXR              |
| [@iwsdk/xr-input](./packages/xr-input)               | WebXR input system for Three.js                   |
| [@iwsdk/vite-plugin-dev](./packages/vite-plugin-dev) | XR emulation, AI agent tooling, and dev browser   |

## Development

```bash
# Use the pinned Node major, install dependencies, and build workspace packages
nvm use
corepack pnpm@10.18.3 run bootstrap

# Build all packages as tgz files (for examples to consume)
npm run build:tgz

# Run an example (fresh install from local tgz packages)
cd examples/locomotion && npm run fresh:dev

# Lint and format
corepack pnpm@10.18.3 run lint
corepack pnpm@10.18.3 run format

# Build a specific package
corepack pnpm@10.18.3 --filter @iwsdk/core build
```

`bootstrap` is also the repair command for a partial or stale source build. It
uses the lockfile, builds packages in dependency order, and generates WebXR
input profiles from the pinned npm asset package instead of making a separate
CDN request. Run `corepack pnpm@10.18.3 run doctor` for environment, proxy, and
generated-output checks.

For a network-restricted checkout whose pnpm store is already warm, use
`corepack pnpm@10.18.3 run bootstrap:offline`. Initial dependency installation
still needs registry access (and honors standard npm/pnpm proxy configuration),
but subsequent profile generation and builds are offline-safe. A directory-linked
`@iwsdk/cli` now keeps a stable launcher; if its `dist` is missing, it prints the
exact package build command instead of leaving a broken executable link.

### Development Workflow

The examples use `file:` dependencies pointing to `.tgz` files built from local packages. This simulates how end-users will consume the packages from npm.

1. **`npm run build:tgz`** - Builds all packages in dependency order and creates `.tgz` archives
2. **`npm run fresh:dev`** (in example) - Cleans `node_modules`, reinstalls from tgz files, and starts dev server

This ensures examples always test against the latest local build.
