# @iwsdk/locomotor

## 0.5.3

## 0.5.2

## 0.5.0

### Patch Changes

- c259681: Add a target-first Create flow and dedicated Desktop 3D starter recipes alongside
  the VR and mixed reality starters. Harden managed-workspace readiness and retain
  configured initial player positions when locomotion runs in a worker. Support
  agent-first in-place scaffolding with `.` and explicit `--force` confirmation
  for non-empty repositories. Keep the common starter source target-agnostic and
  leave browser camera interaction to the application instead of scaffolding an
  assumed mouse-look control scheme. Standardize generated coding-agent guidance
  on `AGENTS.md`, add native OpenCode support and narrow per-harness MCP approval
  settings, and provide `iwsdk adapter prompt` as a catch-all setup path.
  Seed the starter panel with explicit Horizon-kit components, bundled Lucide icons,
  and remotely loaded DM Sans font weights.
  Replace the legacy `@meta-quest/hzdb` compatibility shim with
  `@meta-quest/metavr` 1.3.2, migrate its MCP server name, and launch MetaVR
  telemetry and MCP through Node rather than platform shell shims so Windows uses
  the same safe process path as macOS and Linux.

## 0.4.2

### Patch Changes

- Changelog-formatted bullets (one per user-facing change). Copy into your changeset
  summary / changeset `.md`. `@iwsdk/*` is a fixed group, so all packages bump to 0.4.2.
  - Fix cylinder physics collider configuration when calling the Havok API so cylinder colliders collide correctly.
  - Keep the Havok physics engine and its ~2 MB WASM out of bundles when `features.physics` is disabled; physics is now code-split so `physics: false` apps no longer download it on first load.
  - Break a value-level import cycle (`ecs/world` ↔ `init/world-initializer`) that could leave a component reference `undefined` at class-body evaluation and crash `QueryManager.registerQuery` with `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'bitmask')` in bundled apps.
  - Guard `PhysicsSystem` against an unregistered `Grabbed` component, avoiding unnecessary coupling with the grab system (and a crash) when physics is used without grab.
  - Skip XR input visual initialization when the controller/hand GLTF asset fails to load (e.g. offline or firewalled CDN); input is still tracked without a visual instead of throwing `TypeError: Cannot set properties of undefined (setting 'frustumCulled')`.
  - Spawn the dev runtime with `shell: true` on Windows so the `npm`/`pnpm`/`yarn` `.cmd` shims resolve — fixes `iwsdk dev up` failing with "Failed to start the dev process". Also fixes silent hzdb telemetry on Windows.

## 0.4.1

### Patch Changes

- Version-only release to keep the `@iwsdk/*` package set aligned for 0.4.1.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- Browser-first runtime, action-backed locomotion, ECS-native player rig,
  reference/RAG tooling, runtime-first MCP, quad/cylinder layers, and
  cloud-friendly headless browser.

  ### Browser-First Runtime

  First-class non-XR support: `World.create({ xr: false })` keeps a
  persistent `world.player` origin with `world.camera` parented under it,
  so the same scene runs in a desktop browser and on-device.
  - New `world.input` facade with `input.xr`, stateful keyboard,
    browser gamepad, and deprecated XR compatibility aliases.
  - `input.canvasPointerEvents` config + `CanvasPointerSystem` lifts
    canvas DOM pointer forwarding out of spatial UI into a first-class
    input source.
  - `CameraSystem` now runs while the world is visible (browser
    non-immersive included), only stopping on hidden page/session.
  - `examples/browser-first/`: `xr: false` scene with WASD locomotion,
    RMB-hold pointer-lock mouselook (gimbaled yaw on player + pitch on
    camera), 1st/3rd-person toggle, ray + audio + grab + physics.

  ### Action-Backed Locomotion

  New `world.input.actions` (`InputActionManager`) and
  `ActionLocomotionInputProvider` so locomotion reads intent
  (`locomotion.move`, `.jump`, `.turn`, `.teleport`) instead of polling
  raw devices.
  - Slide, Turn, and Teleport refactored onto the shared provider; XR
    thumbsticks and opt-in browser bindings (WASD, arrow keys, Space,
    standard gamepad) feed the same code paths.
  - New `features.locomotion.browserControls` for first-person browser
    apps.
  - Slide vignette parents to `world.camera` so it tracks the active
    viewport in both XR and browser modes.

  ### ECS-Native Player Rig

  XROrigin and its 7 child spaces (head, raySpaces, gripSpaces,
  indexTipSpaces) are now persistent ECS entities, so apps can parent
  entities under the player rig.
  - New `world.playerEntity`, `world.playerHeadEntity`, and
    `world.playerSpaceEntities` accessors, mirrored on `System`.

  ### Reference & RAG Tooling
  - New `@iwsdk/reference` workspace package with warmup/cache flow and
    a dedicated CLI/MCP parity harness.
  - New `@iwsdk/reference-assets` producer-side ingestion pipeline for
    reference corpus generation, model archive packaging, and versioned
    payload metadata.
  - Reference search wired into the CLI/runtime surface with adapter
    and browser error-handling guardrails.

  ### Runtime-First MCP / CLI Consolidation

  Session resolution, MCP stdio, and adapter management moved into
  `@iwsdk/cli` so generated apps and examples share one entrypoint.
  - MCP adapter configs (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, Copilot) are
    written at project creation by `create-iwsdk` — or on demand via
    `iwsdk adapter sync` — instead of by `dev up` at runtime.
  - `ai.tools` removed from the vite plugin config and dev-up auto-sync
    flow; configs are now a project-level concern.
  - New `iwsdk adapter sync` is the single adapter-write entry point.

  ### Quad & Cylinder Layers

  WebXR composition layers support for quad and cylinder layers, with
  `examples/layers/` demonstrating correct depth occlusion against a
  spinning ball.

  ### Cloud-Friendly Headless Browser

  `@iwsdk/vite-plugin-dev` auto-detects GPUs and falls back to
  SwiftShader (Playwright Chromium's bundled software renderer) on
  GPU-less Linux cloud VMs.
  - Linux `/dev/dri` probe via `hasGpuDevice()`.
  - `IWSDK_GPU=auto|gpu|swiftshader` env override.
  - Selected backend logged on every launch.
  - Auto-installs Chromium and simplifies MCP config lifecycle.

  ### Scaffolding
  - `--canary [url]` replaces `--from <url>`; bare `--canary` uses a
    baked-in CloudFront CDN URL, custom URLs still accepted.
  - `--xr / --no-xr` for browser-only projects.
  - MSE AI Scene Creation knowledge bundled into the project template
    so AI agents can discover/install/launch Meta Spatial Editor and
    drive `mse-agent`.
  - iwer bumped 2.2.0 → 2.2.1 (RemoteControlInterface duration-action
    error handling and upfront device validation in
    `executeSelectSequence`).

  ### Bug Fixes
  - XR pointers, rays, and cursors now hide until controllers connect,
    fixing the origin-flash on session entry. New
    `XRInputManager.disablePointers()` is invoked on no-session,
    no-frame/reference-space, and session-ended paths.
  - Depth occlusion: `isGPUDepth` is now derived from
    `session.depthUsage === 'gpu-optimized'` so the preprocessing and
    material shaders agree, and MinMax-occluded entities persist across
    XR session re-entry.
  - `InputSystem` no longer drops all descendants on the first frame
    (the `dirty`-bit + `isDescendantOf` filter raced with
    `TransformSystem` parenting); descendant arrays now rebuild every
    frame.
  - UI scroll containers: `localClippingEnabled` set so images no
    longer overflow.
  - `vite-plugin-dev`: avoid pointer ID collision between the
    injection bundle and the host app.
  - `Grabbed` component added and used for physics kinematic override.

## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- Truncate CAS asset filenames to stay under jsDelivr's 100-character path component limit, fixing 404 errors during project scaffolding.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- AI-native development with MCP tooling, depth occlusion, poke interactions, environment raycast, and grab system improvements

  ### AI-Native Development

  Integrated AI agent tooling that turns the dev server into an autonomous development environment for Claude Code, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, and OpenAI Codex.
  - **MCP server (`iwsdk-dev-mcp`)** with 34 tools for XR session management, device control, browser observation (screenshots, console logs), and scene/ECS introspection (hierarchy, pause/step/snapshot/diff).
  - **RAG code intelligence (`iwsdk-rag-local`)** for semantic code search, API reference lookup, and ECS component/system discovery.
  - **Three AI modes**: `agent` (headless Playwright), `oversight` (visible browser), `collaborate` (shared browser with DevUI).
  - **Headless browser with auto-recovery** via Playwright-managed Chromium with auto-install, crash recovery, and server-side screenshots.
  - **Per-tool scaffolding** via `--ai-tools` flag generating config files and project context docs for each assistant.
  - **Six Claude Code skills**: planner, grab, ray, UI, debug, physics.

  ### Depth Sensing & Occlusion
  - `DepthSensingSystem` with `DepthOccludable` component supporting `SoftOcclusion`, `HardOcclusion`, and `MinMaxSoftOcclusion` modes, plus stereo support.

  ### Poke / Touch Interaction
  - `TouchPointer` with priority-based pointer selection (Touch > Grab > Ray) and hysteresis thresholds for hand tracking.

  ### Environment Raycast
  - `EnvironmentRaycastSystem` wrapping WebXR Hit Test API for tap-to-place and controller-driven hit testing.

  ### Locomotion
  - Expanded `WorldOptions.features.locomotion` with `enableJumping`, `initialPlayerPosition`, `comfortAssistLevel`, and `turningMethod`.

  ### Grab System
  - `detachOnGrab`, `targetPositionOffset`/`targetQuaternionOffset` on `DistanceGrabbable`, and `useHandPinchForGrab` for hand tracking.

  ### CLI & Scaffolding
  - `--from <url>` for bundle-based project creation, full CLI flags with `-y`, and integrated Meta Spatial Editor installer.

  ### Other
  - `entity.dispose()` for GPU resource cleanup.
  - Migrated to `super-three@0.181.0`.
  - Renamed `@iwsdk/vite-plugin-iwer` to `@iwsdk/vite-plugin-dev`.
  - Physics: center of mass, angular/linear damping, gravity factor.
  - Scene understanding: persistent anchors, shared materials, recentering fix.
