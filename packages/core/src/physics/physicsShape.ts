 * @example Autoâ€‘detect shape from geometry
 * ```ts
 * entity.addComponent(PhysicsShape, {
 *   shape: PhysicsShapeType.Auto
 * })
 * ```
 *
 * @example Create a bouncy sphere
 * ```ts
 * entity.addComponent(PhysicsShape, {

 *   dimensions: [0.5, 0, 0], // radius = 0.5
 *   restitution: 0.8, // bouncy
 *   friction: 0.1 // low friction
 * })
