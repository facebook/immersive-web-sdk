### Minor Changes

- 91047c5: Replace the Meta Spatial Editor integration path with the native IWSDK 3D scene
  editor and native scene JSON workflow.

  Meta Spatial Editor integration is deprecated from this release onward. New and
  migrated projects should use `public/scenes/*.iwsdk.scene.json`, the clean managed
  origin workspace, and direct file authoring with the compact `scene_*` observation
  tools. Code remains supported for procedural behavior, systems,
  animation, and advanced app logic.

  The replacement includes WebGL/IWSDK editor rendering, real scene asset loading,
  camera and orientation controls, transform gizmos, scene hierarchy editing,
  schema-driven component editing, agent screenshots from the editor viewport,
  migrated examples/starters, Meta Spatial removal audits, and automated app plus
  editor render-proof evidence. Authored transforms support zero scale and mirrored
  negative scale; world-preserving reparent operations retain reflections and report
  an operation-specific error only when a singular transform cannot be decomposed.

  The legacy `@iwsdk/glxf` package and fallback level importer are removed.
  `World.loadLevel()` now accepts native `.iwsdk.scene.json` and `.scene.json`
  documents only.

  Projects now declare their scene, asset/component modules, serializable world
  options, and emulator settings in `iwsdk.config.json`. Vite exposes those
  options through `virtual:iwsdk-project`; application code keeps ordinary
  `World.create()` and explicit system registration. Create embeds one common
  starter source instead of fetching Chef recipes, and the retired
  `@iwsdk/starter-assets` workspace package is removed.

  Native scene documents use one manifest-backed `asset` content kind plus groups,
  lights, prefabs, deterministic patterns, components, and constraints. glTF assets,
  procedural Three.js geometry, PBR materials, and custom shaders live in a dedicated
  application asset manifest imported independently by the runtime and editor. The
  editor exposes one unified asset catalog with manifest-derived bounds while keeping
  geometry and material authoring in code.

  The editor and runtime share lowering and expose scene metadata for parity checks.
  Generated Claude and Codex projects include the `iwsdk-scene-composer` skill for
  text, image, and hybrid static scene composition through direct files and the native
  editor. Scene roots can recursively import standalone modules with deterministic
  namespaces, and the managed editor watches root and module changes while preserving
  the last valid render on invalid edits.

  Release artifact verification now records package and documentation hashes and
  rejects package-manager-specific nested `node_modules`. Core and XR input use
  Three.js's public `MathUtils` export so packed modules remain portable.
  The reference-enabled starter and example paths pin patched Sharp 0.35.3 while
  upstream Transformers retains its older dependency range, and the reference
  package now ships complete warmup and offline-hosting guidance.
